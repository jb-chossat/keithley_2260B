This is a python wrapper to communicate with the Keithley 2260B 30-108 power supply.
This project should also allow communication with other Keithley 2260B power supplies, athough some modifications might be needed.
The set of functions provided by the library is incomplete and only consists of the most basic power supply operation.
This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No  101032223.
